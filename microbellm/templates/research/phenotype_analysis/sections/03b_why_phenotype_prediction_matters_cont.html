    The economic impact of accurate phenotype prediction extends beyond individual patient care. Healthcare systems 
    worldwide face increasing pressure from antimicrobial resistance and emerging pathogens. By rapidly identifying 
    bacterial characteristics that influence treatment efficacy—such as biofilm formation capability or inherent 
    antibiotic resistance patterns—predictive models can help optimize antibiotic stewardship programs and reduce 
    the development of resistant strains. This proactive approach to bacterial characterization represents a crucial 
    tool in our ongoing battle against antimicrobial resistance.
