    Understanding how language models predict bacterial phenotypes has significant implications for computational 
    microbiology and bioinformatics research. These predictions can accelerate initial bacterial characterization, 
    guide experimental design, and provide insights into knowledge gaps in current biological databases.

            Accurate phenotype predictions are crucial for clinical microbiology, where rapid identification of 
            bacterial characteristics can inform treatment decisions. Models that excel at predicting pathogenicity 
            and antibiotic resistance markers could serve as valuable preliminary screening tools.
