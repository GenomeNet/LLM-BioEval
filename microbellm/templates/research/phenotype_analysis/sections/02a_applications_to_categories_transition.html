  The clinical and research scenarios above underscore why rapid phenotype assessment matters, but they only hint at the
  breadth of information microbiologists need from language models. Before we compare prediction accuracy, we orient the
  reader around the phenotype families that appear most often in pathogen characterization and surveillance workflows.

  The next section introduces those core phenotype categories&mdash;ranging from Gram staining and motility to virulence traits
  and biosafety considerations&mdash;so that the downstream analyses can be interpreted in the context of the decisions
  practitioners make every day.
