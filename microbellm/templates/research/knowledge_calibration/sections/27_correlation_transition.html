<p>The alignment between model confidence and real-world information availability provides a crucial metric for understanding how well LLMs calibrate their knowledge claims. Models showing strong positive correlations demonstrate an ability to appropriately gauge when they have access to substantial information versus when they should express uncertainty.</p>

<p>This calibration is particularly important in scientific contexts where the distinction between well-studied organisms like <em>E. coli</em> and obscure or recently discovered species can significantly impact the reliability of model-generated information. The following visualization explores these relationships in greater detail.</p>
