<strong>Binomial names</strong> are the universal "first&nbsp;and&nbsp;last names" of every micro-organism, inherited from Linnaean taxonomy. 
The first word (the <em>genus</em>) is always capitalised and groups together species that share a close evolutionary lineage—<em>Escherichia</em>, for example, gathers gut-dwelling rods such as <em>E.&nbsp;coli</em> and <em>E.&nbsp;albertii</em>. 
The second word (the <em>species epithet</em>) is lowercase and distinguishes one member of the genus from another. 
Written in italics and fixed in Latin-style form, the pair becomes a legally recognised label once it is published in the <em>International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</em> and entered into registries such as NCBI or LPSN. 
Because the format is rigid and globally standardised, even a newly coined species should "look right" at a glance; that visual regularity is exactly what makes it possible for an LLM—and sometimes a human reader—to mistake a well-crafted fiction for an authentic taxon.
