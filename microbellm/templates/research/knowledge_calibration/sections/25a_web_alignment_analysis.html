<p>Using the methodology described above, we evaluated how well each model's confidence levels align with actual information availability on the web. Models that show strong correlation between their knowledge claims and web presence demonstrate better calibration—they're more confident about well-documented species and appropriately uncertain about obscure ones. The following visualization highlights the models with the best knowledge-web alignment scores.</p>
