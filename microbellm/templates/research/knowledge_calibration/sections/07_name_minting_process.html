<p>We repeated the name-minting process four times, each run following a different recipe and yielding fifty strains. The first batch combines plain English words, producing labels that no one would confuse for Latin. The second stitches together two random Latin roots, giving every name a classical ring even though the genus is fictitious. In the third set we keep a real, well-known genus and attach a fabricated species epithet, creating hybrids that look half legitimate. The fourth flips the trick: an invented genus is paired with a real species epithet, completing a spectrum that spans obviously fake to taxonomist-plausible. The animation below flips through the four collections in sequence, showing how the linguistic realism ratchets up across the 200-name library.</p>
