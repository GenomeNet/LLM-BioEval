KEY FINDINGS
----------------------------------------

1. Model Calibration Patterns:
   - Models vary significantly in their confidence calibration
   - Some models are conservative (high NA %), others confident (high extensive %)
   - This affects reliability of knowledge claims

2. Species with High Disagreement:
   - Often less common or recently discovered species
   - Streptomyces species show particularly high disagreement
   - May indicate gaps in training data or ambiguous taxonomy

3. Implications for Users:
   - Cross-reference multiple models for uncertain species
   - High agreement on well-studied species (E. coli, S. aureus)
   - Consider model ensemble for critical applications
