<p>Understanding how often a model fabricates traits for nonexistent organisms is crucial before relying on its summaries for real-world microbial annotation</p>
    
<p>To probe where certainty ends and storytelling begins, we built a library of 200 wholly invented strain names, arranged along a realism gradient. At the playful end sit English mash-ups such as Crimson Horizon or Silver Pine—labels no taxonomist would buy.

By asking the same set of questions across this spectrum, we can see exactly when an LLM's confidence tips into hallucination.</p>
