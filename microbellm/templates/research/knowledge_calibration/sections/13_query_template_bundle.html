<p>Each query template is more than a single line of text: it is a three-part bundle that keeps the evaluation machine-readable. The <strong>system prompt</strong> sets the assistant's role, the <strong>user prompt</strong> holds the species placeholder, and a compact <strong>validation&nbsp;JSON</strong> lists the only labels the model is allowed to return (<code>limited</code>, <code>intermediate</code>, <code>extensive</code>, and&nbsp;<code>NA</code>).&nbsp;We ship three such bundles. Template&nbsp;1 omits the <em>NA</em> escape hatch, forcing a knowledge claim; Templates&nbsp;2 and&nbsp;3 keep the same labels but differ in how fully they describe each category to the model.</p>
