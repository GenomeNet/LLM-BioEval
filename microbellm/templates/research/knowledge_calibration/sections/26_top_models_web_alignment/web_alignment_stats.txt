[SUGGESTED TEXT FOR YOUR MANUSCRIPT:]

To assess the alignment between model knowledge and real-world microbial prevalence,
we analyzed the correlation between assigned knowledge levels and web search frequencies
for 72,442 species-model pairs across 22 models.

The analysis revealed substantial variation in knowledge-web alignment, with correlation
coefficients ranging from 0.250 to 0.756 
(mean = 0.610 ± 0.130). This indicates
that models differ significantly in their ability to appropriately calibrate their knowledge
confidence with real-world species prevalence.

The top-performing model, gpt-4, achieved an average correlation of
0.756 between its knowledge assessments and web presence metrics,
suggesting strong alignment with real-world information availability.
 Other high-performing models
included gpt-5-nano (r = 0.740) and
gpt-4.1 (r = 0.725).

In contrast, the poorest-performing models showed weak or negative correlations,
with gemini-2.5-pro achieving only r = 0.250,
indicating a misalignment between model confidence and actual species prevalence
in scientific literature and web resources.

This represents a 3.0-fold difference in alignment quality between
the best and worst performers, highlighting the importance of model selection
for applications requiring accurate assessment of species prevalence and importance.

================================================================================
INTERPRETATION NOTES:
----------------------------------------

- Higher correlation indicates better alignment between model knowledge and web presence
- Correlation > 0.7: Strong alignment
- Correlation 0.4-0.7: Moderate alignment  
- Correlation < 0.4: Weak alignment
- Negative correlation: Inverse relationship (problematic)
