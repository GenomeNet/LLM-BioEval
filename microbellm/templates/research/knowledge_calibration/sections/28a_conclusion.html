<h2 class="section-title">Conclusions and Implications</h2>

<p class="article-text">Our analysis of language model knowledge calibration reveals significant insights into how well current AI systems distinguish between real and fictional information about bacterial species. The correlation between model confidence and web presence provides a quantifiable measure of knowledge calibration quality.</p>

<p class="article-text">The stark differences between top-performing and struggling models highlight the importance of proper calibration mechanisms in language model training. Models with strong web alignment demonstrate they can appropriately modulate their confidence based on the actual availability of information—a crucial capability for scientific applications where distinguishing established facts from speculation is essential.</p>

<p class="article-text">These findings have important implications for deploying language models in microbiology and related fields. Models with poor calibration may confidently provide information about non-existent species or fail to recognize well-documented organisms, potentially misleading researchers or students. Conversely, well-calibrated models can serve as valuable tools for preliminary research, helping identify knowledge gaps and directing users to areas requiring further investigation.</p>

<p class="article-text">Future work should focus on developing training methodologies that explicitly optimize for knowledge calibration, particularly in specialized scientific domains. Additionally, implementing real-time calibration checks against authoritative databases could help models maintain accuracy as scientific knowledge evolves. The metrics and visualizations presented here provide a framework for ongoing evaluation of language model reliability in microbiological applications.</p>
