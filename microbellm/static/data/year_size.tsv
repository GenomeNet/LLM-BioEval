Finetune FLOP: 5.23e19 Base model FLOP: 7.8e+22 Total: 78052170300000010000000			Confident	Nowadays, open-source large language models like LLaMA have emerged. Recent developments have incorporated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) to align these models with human goals. However, SFT methods treat all training data with mixed quality equally, while RLFT methods require high-quality pairwise or ranking-based preference data. In this study, we present a novel framework, named OpenChat, to advance open-source language models with mixed-quality data. Specifically, we consider the general SFT training data, consisting of a small amount of expert data mixed with a large proportion of sub-optimal data, without any preference labels. We propose the C(onditioned)-RLFT, which regards different data sources as coarse-grained reward labels and learns a class-conditioned policy to leverage complementary data quality information. Interestingly, the optimal policy in C-RLFT can be easily solved through single-stage, RL-free supervised learning, which is lightweight and avoids costly human preference labeling. Through extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks, our openchat-13b fine-tuned with C-RLFT achieves the highest average performance among all 13b open-source language models. Moreover, we use AGIEval to validate the model generalization performance, in which only openchat-13b surpasses the base model. Finally, we conduct a series of analyses to shed light on the effectiveness and robustness of OpenChat. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat and https://huggingface.co/openchat.	5		Open weights (unrestricted)	China,China,China	2025-08-01 16:23:10+00:00						Academia,Academia,Industry

Unspecified unreleased		Unknown	Today, we’re releasing OpenAI o3 and o4-mini, the latest in our o-series of models trained to think for longer before responding. These are the smartest models we’ve released to date, representing a step change in ChatGPT's capabilities for everyone from curious users to advanced researchers. For the first time, our reasoning models can agentically use and combine every tool within ChatGPT—this includes searching the web, analyzing uploaded files and other data with Python, reasoning deeply about visual inputs, and even generating images. Critically, these models are trained to reason about when and how to use tools to produce detailed and thoughtful answers in the right output formats, typically in under a minute, to solve more complex problems. This allows them to tackle multi-faceted questions more effectively, a step toward a more agentic ChatGPT that can independently execute tasks on your behalf.

These represent two axes of intelligence.  Unsupervised learning increases world model accuracy and intuition. Models like GPT‑3.5, GPT‑4, and GPT‑4.5 advance this paradigm. Scaling reasoning⁠, on the other hand, teaches models to think and produce a chain of thought before they respond, allowing them to tackle complex STEM or logic problems. Models like OpenAI o1 and OpenAI o3‑mini advance this paradigm. GPT‑4.5 is an example of scaling unsupervised learning by scaling up compute and data, along with architecture and optimization innovations. GPT‑4.5 was trained on Microsoft Azure AI supercomputers.

Mistral Small 3 is on par with Llama 3.3 70B instruct, while being more than 3x faster on the same hardware.  Mistral Small 3 is a pre-trained and instructed model catered to the ‘80%’ of generative AI tasks—those that require robust language and instruction following performance, with very low latency.  We designed this new model to saturate performance at a size suitable for local deployment. Particularly, Mistral Small 3 has far fewer layers than competing models, substantially reducing the time per forward pass. At over 81% accuracy on MMLU and 150 tokens/s latency, Mistral Small is currently the most efficient model of its category.  We’re releasing both a pretrained and instruction-tuned checkpoint under Apache 2.0. The checkpoints can serve as a powerful base for accelerating progress. Note that Mistral Small 3 is neither trained with RL nor synthetic data, so is earlier in the model production pipeline than models like Deepseek R1 (a great and complementary piece of open-source technology!). It can serve as a great base model for building accrued reasoning capacities. We look forward to seeing how the open-source community adopts and customizes it.

Phi-4-Mini is a 3.8-billion-parameter language model trained on high-quality web and synthetic data, significantly outperforming recent open-source models of similar size and matching the performance of models twice its size on math and coding tasks requiring complex reasoning. This achievement is driven by a carefully curated synthetic data recipe emphasizing high-quality math and coding datasets. Compared to its predecessor, Phi-3.5-Mini, Phi-4-Mini features an expanded vocabulary size of 200K tokens to better support multilingual applications, as well as group query attention for more efficient long-sequence generation. Phi-4-Multimodal is a multimodal model that integrates text, vision, and speech/audio input modalities into a single model. Its novel modality extension approach leverages LoRA adapters and modality-specific routers to allow multiple inference modes combining various modalities without interference. For example, it now ranks first in the OpenASR leaderboard to date, although the LoRA component of the speech/audio modality has just 460 million parameters. Phi-4-Multimodal supports scenarios involving (vision + language), (vision + speech), and (speech/audio) inputs, outperforming larger vision-language and speech-language models on a wide range of tasks. Additionally, we experiment to further train Phi-4-Mini to enhance its reasoning capabilities. Despite its compact 3.8-billion-parameter size, this experimental version achieves reasoning performance on par with or surpassing significantly larger models, including DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B.

Our training dataset is a scaled-up version of the one used for phi-2, composed of heavily filtered publicly available web data and synthetic data. The model is also further aligned for robustness, safety, and chat format. We also provide parameter-scaling results with a 7B, 14B models trained for 4.8T tokens, called phi-3-small, phi-3-medium, both significantly more capable than phi-3-mini (e.g., respectively 75%, 78% on MMLU, and 8.7, 8.9 on MT-bench). To enhance multilingual, multimodal, and long-context capabilities, we introduce three models in the phi-3.5 series: phi-3.5-mini, phi-3.5-MoE, and phi-3.5-Vision. The phi-3.5-MoE, a 16 x 3.8B MoE model with 6.6 billion active parameters, achieves superior performance in language reasoning, math, and code tasks compared to other open-source models of similar scale, such as Llama 3.1 and the Mixtral series, and on par with Gemini-1.5-Flash and GPT-4o-mini.

The blog post gives a figure of 390 TFLOPS/GPU, but this may have been the utilization rate for Behemoth, or all of the models together. Using this utilization, we have: Compute = 390 TFLOP/s * 5 million hours = 7.02e24 FLOP (This value is higher than the compute implied by parameters and tokens, and suggests utilization may have been lower for Scout than for Behemoth.)

Llama 4 Scout, a 17 billion active parameter model with 16 experts, is the best multimodal model in the world in its class and is more powerful than all previous generation Llama models, while fitting in a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. Additionally, Llama 4 Scout offers an industry-leading context window of 10M and delivers better results than Gemma 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, and Mistral 3.1 across a broad range of widely reported benchmarks. Llama 4 Maverick, a 17 billion active parameter model with 128 experts, is the best multimodal model in its class, beating GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash across a broad range of widely reported benchmarks, while achieving comparable results to the new DeepSeek v3 on reasoning and coding—at less than half the active parameters. Llama 4 Maverick offers a best-in-class performance to cost ratio with an experimental chat version scoring ELO of 1417 on LMArena.

Llama-4-Maverick	Meta AI	2025-04-05	The Llama 4 herd: The beginning of a new era of natively multimodal AI innovation	400000000000	2.24E+24	22T training tokens per model card:  https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-models/blob/main/models/llama4/MODEL_CARD.md     Maverick was trained using co-distillation from Llama 4 Behemoth. It isn't 100% clear that all 22T tokens used distillation, but we assume this for the time being.  Estimating training compute from parameters and tokens: Compute = 6 FLOP per token per parameter * 17B active parameters * 22T tokens = 2.244e24 FLOP (Implying mean throughput was 262 TFLOPS/GPU, or 13.2% MFU in FP8)   The model card also states that Llama 4 Maverick used 2.38M H100-hours. The blog post gives a figure of 390 TFLOPS/GPU, but this may have been the utilization rate for Behemoth, or all of the models together. Using this utilization, we have: Compute = 390 TFLOP/s * 2.38 million hours = 3.342e24 FLOP (This value is higher than the compute implied by parameters and tokens, and suggests utilization may have been lower for Maverick than for Behemoth.)			Likely	We’re sharing the first models in the Llama 4 herd, which will enable people to build more personalized multimodal experiences. Llama 4 Scout, a 17 billion active parameter model with 16 experts, is the best multimodal model in the world in its class and is more powerful than all previous generation Llama models, while fitting in a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. Additionally, Llama 4 Scout offers an industry-leading context window of 10M and delivers better results than Gemma 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, and Mistral 3.1 across a broad range of widely reported benchmarks. Llama 4 Maverick, a 17 billion active parameter model with 128 experts, is the best multimodal model in its class, beating GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash across a broad range of widely reported benchmarks, while achieving comparable results to the new DeepSeek v3 on reasoning and coding—at less than half the active parameters. Llama 4 Maverick offers a best-in-class performance to cost ratio with an experimental chat version scoring ELO of 1417 on LMArena. These models are our best yet thanks to distillation from Llama 4 Behemoth, a 288 billion active parameter model with 16 experts that is our most powerful yet and among the world’s smartest LLMs. Llama 4 Behemoth outperforms GPT-4.5, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and Gemini 2.0 Pro on several STEM benchmarks.

Compact and capable architecture: Our new model has a total of 270 million parameters: 170 million embedding parameters due to a large vocabulary size and 100 million for our transformer blocks. Thanks to the large vocabulary of 256k tokens, the model can handle specific and rare tokens, making it a strong base model to be further fine-tuned in specific domains and languages. Extreme energy efficiency: A key advantage of Gemma 3 270M is its low power consumption. Internal tests on a Pixel 9 Pro SoC show the INT4-quantized model used just 0.75% of the battery for 25 conversations, making it our most power-efficient Gemma model. Instruction following: An instruction-tuned model is released alongside a pre-trained checkpoint. While this model is not designed for complex conversational use cases, it’s a strong model that follows general instructions right out of the box. Production-ready quantization: Quantization-Aware Trained (QAT) checkpoints are available, enabling you to run the models at INT4 precision with minimal performance degradation, which is essential for deploying on resource-constrained devices.

Gemini-Flash-1.5 	Google DeepMind	2024-05-10	Gemini 1.5: Unlocking multimodal understanding across millions of tokens of context			"Gemini 1.5 Flash is a dense Transformer based model that is online distilled [...] from Gemini 1.5 Pro."			Unknown	In this report, we introduce the Gemini 1.5 family of models, representing the next generation of highly compute-efficient multimodal models capable of recalling and reasoning over fine-grained information from millions of tokens of context, including multiple long documents and hours of video and audio. The family includes two new models: (1) an updated Gemini 1.5 Pro, which exceeds the February version on the great majority of capabilities and benchmarks; (2) Gemini 1.5 Flash, a more lightweight variant designed for efficiency with minimal regression in quality. Gemini 1.5 models achieve near-perfect recall on long-context retrieval tasks across modalities, improve the state-of-the-art in long-document QA, long-video QA and long-context ASR, and match or surpass Gemini 1.0 Ultra’s state-of-the-art performance across a broad set of benchmarks. Studying the limits of Gemini 1.5’s long-context ability, we find continued improvement in next-token prediction and near-perfect retrieval (>99%) up to at least 10M tokens, a generational leap over existing models such as Claude 3.0 (200k) and GPT-4 Turbo (128k). Finally, we highlight real-world use cases, such as Gemini 1.5 collaborating with professions on their completing their tasks achieving 26 to 75% time savings across 10 different job categories, as well as surprising new capabilities of large language models at the frontier; when given a grammar manual for Kalamang, a language with fewer than 200 speakers worldwide, the model learns to translate English to Kalamang at a similar level to a person who learned from the same content.

Assuming that’s valid, the pretraining of this model would have required 6 * (37 billion) * (14.8 trillion) = 3e24 FLOP. If we assume DeepSeek’s training cluster consists of H800s with the PCIe form factor, then each should be capable of 1.5e15 FP8 per second, and the implied model FLOP utilization (MFU) of DeepSeek v3’s 55 day training run ends up being around 23%."  6 FLOP/token/param * 14.8T tokens * 37B active params = 3.29e24 FLOP (pretraining) 1.2e23 FLOP (post-training) 6.1e23 FLOP (fine-tuning)  Total compute: 3.29e24 + 1.2e23 + 6.1e23 = 4.02e24	Unspecified unreleased		Confident	We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.
