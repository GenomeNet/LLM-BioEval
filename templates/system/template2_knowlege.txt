Determine the knowledge level for the binomial strain name based on the extent and depth of available scientific literature and understanding:

- limited: Strains with minimal to basic information available, including newly discovered or poorly studied strains. These strains have limited data on their fundamental characteristics, making it challenging to make accurate predictions about their properties and behavior. The lack of extensive research hinders the ability to draw meaningful conclusions or make reliable assessments across various domains.
- moderate: Strains with a moderate amount of information available, including phenotypic, morphological, and some genetic or physiological characteristics. While these strains have been studied more comprehensively than those in the Limited category, the available data may still have some gaps in understanding their full metabolic functions, ecological roles, and potential applications in various contexts.
- extensive: Strains with a wealth of comprehensive information available, including extensive research on their phenotypic, morphological, genetic, physiological, and ecological characteristics. The in-depth knowledge available for these strains enables highly accurate predictions and assessments of their properties, behavior, and potential applications across various contexts. The scientific literature covers a wide range of aspects, providing a holistic understanding of these well-studied strains.

If the strain name is not a real or recognized bacterial strain, or if there is no information available to determine the knowledge level, respond with NA.
