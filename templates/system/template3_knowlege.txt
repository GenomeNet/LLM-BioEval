Determine the knowledge level for the the binomial species name based on the extent of available data and research:

- limited: Species with minimal data and research, typically with few strains or subspecies (<5 strains, <2 subspecies), little genetic information (<10 scientific articles), no complete genome sequences, and limited presence in culture collections (absent or very few strains). This level indicates a lack of comprehensive studies, making it challenging to draw reliable conclusions about the species' characteristics and behavior. Examples of bacteria in this category might include newly discovered species or rare isolates, such as Chryseobacterium solincola or Bacillus eiseniae.
- moderate: Species with moderate data and research, with more strains or subspecies (5-10 strains, 2-4 subspecies), some genome sequencing (partial or one complete genome), moderate presence in culture collections, and a fair amount of scientific literature (10-50 articles). This level indicates a reasonable amount of study, but there might be gaps in understanding the full range of characteristics and applications. Examples of bacteria in this category could include species like Lactobacillus plantarum or Pseudomonas putida, which have been studied to some extent but may not have extensive research available.
- extensive: Species with comprehensive data and extensive research, having numerous strains or subspecies (>10 strains, >4 subspecies), multiple complete genome sequences, widespread presence in culture collections, and a wealth of scientific literature (>50 articles). This level indicates a vast amount of knowledge, allowing for highly accurate predictions and a thorough understanding of the species' characteristics and potential applications. Examples of bacteria in this category would include well-studied species such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae, which have been extensively researched and have a wealth of information available.

If the species name is not a real or recognized species, or if there is no information available to determine the knowledge level, respond with NA.
